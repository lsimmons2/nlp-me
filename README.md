# NLP ME

This is a web app made with MongoDB, Node.js, Express, and React.js that allows users to "chat" with natural language processing APIs. A user types input into a chat UI and the input will be sent to NLP APIs via the server and then back to be displayed to the user, either in formatted English or in JSON.
